   * Set position hint for this positional.
   * <p>
   * Position hints is a or'ed list of:
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>Line position hint  - FIRST, LAST, TOP, BOTTON, LEFT, RIGHT
   * <li>Point position hint - CENTER, NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST,
   *                           NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST
   * <li>Algorithm           - STATIC, DYNAMIC
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>
   * Line position hints are interpreted as follows:
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li> GPosition.FIRST  - Attach to first polyline point.
   * <li> GPosition.LAST   - Attach to last polyline point.
   * <li> GPosition.TOP    - Attach to top polyline as it appears on screen
   *                         when rendered.
   * <li> GPosition.BOTTOM - Attach to bottom polyline as it appears on screen
   *                         when rendered.
   * <li> GPosition.RIGHT  - Attach to right polyline as it appears on screen
   *                         when rendered.
   * <li> GPosition.LEFT   - Attach to left polyline as it appears on screen
   *                         when rendered.
   * </ul>
   *
   * If a line position hint is not given, the text is attached to the n'th
   * point of the polyline according to when it was added to the segment,
   * i.e, the first text added is attached to the first coordinate, the second
   * text added is attatched to the second coordinate and so on. This is
   * convenient if there is a text associated with each line vertex.
   *
   * <p>
   * For the above, the given point becomes the initial approach for
   * positioning. If this initial position is outside the window (and position
   * hint not explicitly set to GPosition.STATIC) the text is moved along
   * the polyline till it becomes fully visible.
   *
   * <p>
   * If text position hint is GPosition.MIDDLE, the initial position is
   * the center of the polyline bounding box. If this point is not visble
   * the text is not rendered.
   *
   * <p>
   * At this point an anchor point is found for the text. Now the point
   * positioning text hints are examined:
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li> GPosition.CENTER    - Put text centered on top of anchor point.
   * <li> GPosition.NORTH     - Put text above anchor point.
   * <li> GPosition.SOUTH     - Put text below anchor point.
   * <li> GPosition.EAST      - Put text to the right of anchor point.
   * <li> GPosition.WEST      - Put text to the left of anchor point.   
   * <li> GPosition.NORTHEAST - Put text above and right of the anchor point.
   * <li> GPosition.NORTHWEST - Put text above and left of the anchor point.
   * <li> GPosition.SOUTHEAST - Put text below and right of the anchor point.
   * <li> GPosition.SOUTHWEST - Put text below and left of the anchor point.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>
   * If a point positioing hint is not given, the defualt is GPosition.CENTER
   * unless line position hint is GPosition.TOP (implying GPosition.NORTH),
   * GPosition.BOTTOM (implying GPosition.SOUTH), GPosition.LEFT (implying
   * GPosition.WEST) or GPosition:RIGHT (implying GPosition.EAST).
   *
   * <p>
   * Now, if the text in this location overlap an already positioned text,
   * it is further adjusted (unless position hint is not explicitly set to
   * GPosition.STATIC as discussed above). It is again moved along the
   * polyline till a free location is found. If this cannot be acheived,
   * the text is not rendered
   *
   * @see GPosition
   * 
   * @param positionHint  Position hint for this positional.
